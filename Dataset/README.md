# Dataset description:

  DGA-based malware PCAPs:
  
  The dataset contains the Packet Captures (PCAP) of DGA-based malware samples from different DGA families. The malware samples were executed in an isolated environment for at least 10 minutes (most malware samples were executed for 30 minutes). The PCAPs might contain malicious payload and might be flagged by the antivirus, so please be careful. The PCAPs are in a password-protected compressed file and the password is "infected".
